        Music and training on <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>
    </h1>
        <p>
            On this website, I'm going to discuss the impact of Gran Turismo's music choices, as well as aspects that make it so good for driver training.

        <p> To me this choice for the intro you hear every time you open the game says a lot about the achievements the game has made in creating such a high-quality simulation that's also fun for the casual gamer. It represents such a mind-blowing experience of playing a game where you're truly learning to drive a car on its limits. On top of that, the in-game music turns to be more relaxing elevator-like music which is nice to have in the background while you navigate the game, and it's extremely nice to have during long tedious tasks like taking photos or creating liveries. I would compare this two-way use of music to the Reality Effect of trying to zone you in for the task at hand. This can be seen with hype music for in-game racing and the game's intro, or as relaxing music, that lets you stay focused for long tedious tasks like creating a livery for a car. </p>

            I want to first start by talking about the reality effect this game creates as its attention to detail on all visuals in this game are beyond the level of any other sim racing game out there, and are some of the best world renders I have seen in any video game. On top of that, with Polyphony's work with Playstation's VR sector, PLaying VR in this game isn't just like you're stepping into a new world, it truly feels like you are just here in reality at the race track in whatever car you dream of driving. And when you combine that with the precision that is top split racing on the game, where you race side by side with a driver through half of the track where you can see him out of the edge of your vision... it's incomparable how amazing of a reality it shows you is possible.
